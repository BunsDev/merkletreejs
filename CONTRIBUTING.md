Please note that this project adheres to a [Code of Conduct](https://www.contributor-covenant.org/version/2/0/code_of_conduct/). By participating, you agree to uphold this code.

## How to Contribute

### 1. Reporting Issues

If you find a bug, have a feature request, or encounter a problem with the library, please [open an issue](https://github.com/merkletreejs/merkletreejs/issues). When reporting an issue, include:

- A clear and descriptive title.
- Steps to reproduce the problem, if applicable.
- Expected and actual behavior.

### 2. Submitting Pull Requests (PRs)

We welcome contributions to the codebase! Before submitting a PR, please:

1. Fork the repository and create a new branch for your changes.
2. Follow the coding standards and project structure.
3. Write clear commit messages.
4. Include tests for new features or bug fixes.
5. Ensure that all tests pass and the code is linted.
6. Provide a detailed description of the changes in the PR.

#### Important Note:

We do **not accept pull requests for small typo fixes** in documentation or comments. Unfortunately, such PRs have become a frequent source of spam. If you identify a typo, you may report it in an issue instead.

### 3. Coding Guidelines

- Use consistent code formatting. Follow the existing style in the project.
- Add tests for any new features or changes.
- Keep PRs focused and concise. If a PR addresses multiple unrelated issues, consider splitting it into smaller PRs.

### 4. Testing

To run the tests locally:

```bash
npm install
npm test
```

Ensure all tests pass before submitting your PR.

### 5. Documentation

If your change impacts the public API, update the relevant documentation in the README.md or other relevant files.
